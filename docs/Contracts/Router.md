# Router Smart Contract API

Routers are stateless and are boun to change over time. We may change it if there is need for more functionality or a better smart contract pattern is discovered.

## Code
The code to the Router.sol file can be found here.
N.B To be updated when I confirm the link to the final repo.

## Networks and Address

| Network | Address |

## Functions

### factory
Returns the address to the factory smart contract
```solidity
function factory() public view returns (address)
```

### WETH
Returns the address to the WETH smart contract
```solidity
function WETH() public view returns (address)
```

### addLiquidity
Adds Liquidity to an `ERC20 - ERC20` pool.

Always remember to: 
- Give the router an allowance for any of the tokens on the amount desired.
- Add the assets in a ratio based on the price when transaction happened.

A pool is created automatically with the desired amount of tokens if it does not exist. 
```Solidity
function addLiquidity(
    address tokenA, 
    address tokenB, 
    uint256 amountADesired,
    uint256 amountBDesired,
    uint256 amountAMin,
    uint256 amountBMin, 
    address to, 
    uint256 deadline 
) external returns(
    uint256 amountA, 
    uint256 amountB,  
    uint256 liquidity 
) 
```

### addLiquidityETH
Adds liquidity to an `ERC20 - WETH` pool with ETH
Always remember to: 
- Give the router an allowance for the token on the amount desired.
- Add the assets in a ratio based on the price when transaction happened.
- The amount of ETH desired will be gotten from the `msg.value` property.
- Any leftover ETH will be returned to the `msg.sender`.

A pool is created automatically with the desired amount of tokens if it does not exist.
```solidity
function addliquidityETH(
    address token,
    uint256 amountTokenDesired,
    uint256 amountTokenMin,
    uint256 amountETHMin,
    address to,
    uint256 dealine
) external payable returns (
    uint256 amountToken,
    uint256 amountETH,
    uin6256 liquidity
)
```
